This display features a 2.8" LCD with 320x240 16-bit color pixels and a resistive touch overlay. The plate uses the high speed SPI interface on the Pi and can use the mini display as a console, X window port, displaying images or video etc. Best of all it plugs right in on top!

It's designed to fit nicely onto the Pi 1 Model A or B but also works OK with the Pi Zero, Pi 3, Pi 2 or Pi 1 Model A+ or B+ (any Pi with a 2x20 connector) as long as you don't mind the PCB overhangs the USB ports by 5mm, see the photos above. If you have a modern Pi with a 2x20 connector, you may want to grab a PiTFT 2.8" Plus which does not overhang
